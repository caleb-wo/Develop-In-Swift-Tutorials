# Description

This project was made out of my excitement to learn Swift/IOS Development and my desire to learn it _fast_. Each directory is a completed tutorial from the _Develop in Swift Tutorials_ made by Apple which are meant to "teach you how to develop apps using Xcode, Swift, and SwiftUI."

## Intro

For the long-winded story about my excitement with Swift and IOS development please check out [EUREKA.md](EUREKA.md).

Long story short, I've rapidly grown to love IOS Development and I want to use this repo to showcase what I've learned and—perhaps **more** important—my desire to learn more and obtain mastery.
