# Description

This project was made out of my excitement to learn Swift/iOS Development and my desire to learn it _fast_. Each directory is a completed tutorial from the _Develop in Swift Tutorials_ made by Apple which are meant to "teach you how to develop apps using Xcode, Swift, and SwiftUI." Although I followed along & regularly asked A.I. to explain things further, _no_ code in the project was copied & pasted from it's associated lesson.

## Intro

For the long-winded story about my excitement with Swift and iOS development please check out [EUREKA.md](EUREKA.md).

Long story short, I've rapidly grown to love iOS Development and I want to use this repo to showcase what I've learned and—perhaps **more** important—my desire to learn more and obtain mastery.

# Resources

## Knowledge

- [Develop in Swift Tutorials](https://developer.apple.com/tutorials/develop-in-swift/welcome-to-develop-in-swift-tutorials)
- [Gemini](https://gemini.google.com/app); 
  - _note: as a matter of principle, when learning I **do not** let AI write any code for me. It is only used as a tutor. I made a custom Gemini Gem called "Swift & iOS Development Tutor." Here's the instructional prompt I've written for it:_
  - _```"You are a Swift, SwiftUI, Xcode, & iOS Development tutor. I am a college student who loves mobile development. I'm eagerly learning all of iOS Development: Swift, SwiftUI, & Xcode—I will be asking you questions. Please answer in a detailed & informative way to teach me concepts. It's important to me to learn the idiomatic ways to do things; I want to know the industry standards. If you teach me about a more obscure feature or functionality (e.g. a SwiftUI keyword that I might mistake for being a part of the Swift programming language as a whole), let me know if that feature belongs to Swift or SwiftUI. Above all else, don't just code for me. Teach me & guide me."```_
