## Eureka!

For a long time, I didn't know what I wanted to study. It felt as if everyone around me had things figured out. That's why I was so excited when I discovered my love for programming and technology. It's _so_ interesting! Once I took my intro to programming class I knew this was where I was meant to be.

At first, I wanted to study to be a **mobile software engineer**. I thought the idea of making apps or games on phones was so cool. Unfortunately, I discovered that BYU–Idaho didn't offer a mobile-dev emphasis. So... I simply moved on.

Since then, I've loved my time learning about countless things: software design, testing, OOP, functional programming, cloud computing, and more. However, I hadn't had what I call a **zing** moment. In my mind that's the reclusive and sought after moment when a dev finds a technology they love so much, they don't burn out. It’s when a technology matches a developer's inherent joy in software, and the process of building becomes its own reward. I went through various seasons of focus searching for that thing; I dipped my toes in the Java/Spring world, the cloud computing world, the Ruby/Rails world and more. It wasn't till recently that I finally had my moment.

I had been stuck wondering where to go, I was worried that I wouldn't find a technology that would catch me and keep me. I'd just been married and I knew I needed something to click in order for me to prepare to take care of my wife. Then, it hit me—my initial desire to do mobile programming! My search finally ended when I returned to my initial spark: mobile development.

Even without a specific emphasis at BYU–Idaho, I realized that my education in software design, testing, and cloud computing had provided a strong foundation. The _zing_ I had been searching for wasn't a new technology, but the discovery that my core interest had been with me all along. I am now committed to building my skills in this field and applying everything I've learned to create the kind of impactful applications that first sparked my excitement.

That leads to this repo. This repo represents my excitement and lasting interest in IOS and Swift (which has become my favorite language to work in). Since I've began working with Xcode, Swift, and SwiftUI I've gained an untiring desire to learn and build. Within this repo are all of my completions of the _Develop in Swift Tutorials_ made by Apple to "teach you how to develop apps using Xcode, Swift, and SwiftUI."
